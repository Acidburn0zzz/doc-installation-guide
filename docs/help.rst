Where to find help
==================

Many users will be glad to help you and guide you through your first steps with Linux if you are nice and patient with them and if you give them the information they require to understand the issues you're facing.

Linux Mint forums
-----------------

The best place to find help is on the Linux Mint forums:

https://forums.linuxmint.com/

.. hint::
    Search the forums before asking, in case someone else already asked the same question.

Linux Mint chat room
--------------------

Another great place to find help is in the IRC chat room.

To reach the chat room from within Linux Mint, launch :menuselection:`Menu --> Internet --> HexChat`.

If you're using another operating system, you can reach the chat room via a web interface by clicking `Here <https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.spotchat.org/?i#linuxmint-help>`_.

.. hint::
    Many people are connected to the chat room but only look at it now and then. The best way to use the chat room is to ask your question once and stay connected until you get an answer. It can sometimes take a few hours for somebody to look at the chat room, see your question and reply to you. Don't just ask and quit after a few minutes, that is frustrating to you and even more frustrating to people who know the answer and couldn't reply to you because you already left.
