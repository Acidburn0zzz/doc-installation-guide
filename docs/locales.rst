Language Support
================

Language support includes translations but also packages related to spell-checking, synonyms, hyphenation and dictionnaries which enhance your experience in software applications such as LibreOffice.

.. note::
	Depending on your locale and whether or not you were online during the installation, some of these packages might already be installed.

1. Launch the language settings by opening :menuselection:`Menu --> Preferences --> Languages`.
